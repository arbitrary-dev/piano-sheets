# Piano sheets

Nice sheets for training.

Compile them with [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org):

```
lilypond *.ly
```

## PDF

Here's a list of compiled PDFs for handicapped people,
that can't install LilyPond and compile from sources themselves:
- [Niccolò Paganini – Caprice (fragment)](https://github.com/arbitrary-dev/piano-sheets/releases/download/pdfs/paganini-caprice.pdf)
- [Elena Gnesina – Etude](https://github.com/arbitrary-dev/piano-sheets/releases/download/pdfs/gnesina-etude.pdf)
- [Edvard Grieg – Piano Concerto](https://github.com/arbitrary-dev/piano-sheets/releases/download/pdfs/grieg-piano-concerto.pdf)
